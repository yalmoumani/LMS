2. Assistant: Assistants support teachers in managing courses, grading assignments, and providing additional guidance to students.

3. Administrator: Administrators have overall control of the system, managing user accounts, handling system configurations, and ensuring smooth operation of the LMS.

4. Student: Students can enroll in courses, access learning materials, submit assignments, participate in discussions, and track their own progress.
